[Overall]

This is the pre-process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of Thai characters.

This software will read the pictures of Thai characters (from Thai OCR Corpus of NECTEC, www.nectec.or.th) to be training set.

Then, the software will extract the feature of each charator.

The algorithm of feature extraction of each charactor is that each charatore will be divided into 3*3 or 4*4 parts. Each part will be counted the ratio of black coulor and white coulor.
